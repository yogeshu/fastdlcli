## 💻 Installation (Local Testing)

Clone your repo and set it up locally:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yogeshu/fastdlcli.git
cd fastdlcli
npm link
````

This creates a global CLI command on your system called `fastdlcli`.

---

## 🧠 Usage

### Download a single file

```bash
fastdlcli https://example.com/file.zip
```

### Download multiple files

```bash
fastdlcli https://site.com/file1.mp4 https://site.com/file2.pdf
```

### Use a `downloads.txt` list

Create a text file named `downloads.txt` in the same folder:

```
https://example.com/file1.zip
https://example.com/file2.mp4
```

Then run:

```bash
fastdlcli
```

### Paste URLs interactively

If no arguments and no file exist, `fastdlcli` will ask you to paste URLs directly in terminal:

```
📥 Enter URLs (separated by space, comma, or newline):
> https://example.com/file1.zip https://example.com/file2.mp4
```

---

## 🧰 Input Priority

1. Command-line URLs
2. `downloads.txt` file
3. Interactive prompt
